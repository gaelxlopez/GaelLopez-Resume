        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm a college student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), and I have always been driven and ambitious. As the youngest in a family of five, I learned early on that I had to be assertive and confident in order to hold my own. But I also learned the value of teamwork and communication, thanks to the many family trips and events we shared.

e<br><br>

        One of my biggest passions in life is soccer. I fell in love with the game at a young age and have been playing ever since. Whether it's a competitive game or just a casual kickabout with friends, I always look forward to getting out on the field and showing off my skills. Soccer has taught me the importance of dedication, discipline, and hard work, and I believe that these lessons have helped me in all areas of my life.

<br><br>

        Another passion of mine is marketing. I'm currently majoring in marketing at UCR, and I find the subject fascinating. I love the challenge of coming up with creative campaigns and finding new ways to connect with consumers. I'm always on the lookout for new marketing trends and techniques, and I'm excited to see where my education and skills will take me in the future. When I'm not playing soccer or studying, I like to hit the gym and lift weights. I find that lifting helps me stay focused and energized, and it's a great way to relieve stress after a long day of classes. Plus, I love the feeling of accomplishment that comes with hitting a new personal record or setting a new goal.In addition to my athletic and academic pursuits, I'm also an amateur cook. I love experimenting with new recipes and flavors, and I find that cooking is a great way to unwind and relax. Whether I'm whipping up a quick meal for myself or hosting a dinner party for friends, I always try to put my own personal spin on things and make the food as delicious as possible. Looking back on my life so far, I'm grateful for all of the experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today. I believe that my passion for soccer, marketing, weightlifting, and cooking have helped me develop important skills and qualities like discipline, teamwork, creativity, and perseverance. And I'm excited to see where these passions will take me in the future, both personally and professionally.
